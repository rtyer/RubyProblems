Description:

It’s the summer of 1923. You and a few friends are on holiday in Goeteborg, Sweden. After one round of starköl in the Nobel Bar you start to feel funny. So you make fun of people around you – loudly. As you spot someone who has that distinct Einstein-haircut you tell him that "only two things are infinite, the universe and your stupidity, and I’m not sure about the former".

As it turns out this man is indeed Einstein celebrating after his nobel price acceptance speech – and now he is mad at you. To settle this issue like civilized gentlemen he proposes a little drinking game called "fizz-buzz". In order to leave the table without a serious alcohol poisoning but some of your pride left you decide to do what every person would do: Cheat!

The rules

Any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizzbuzz. A player who makes a mistake has to take a drink. 
Einstein will choose a random number to start with – for example: 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz…
